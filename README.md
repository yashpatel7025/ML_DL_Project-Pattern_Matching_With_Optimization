
## Pattern Macthing with Optimization using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

- User upload the images with label which needs to be recognized later by the system
- All the images are processed, the face is detectd by the **MTCNN Algorithm** and and detected face image will be saved in the database
- For each image(face) **128-d vector representation** is generated by pre-trained **dlib model or facenet model**.
- These encodings are then dumped in **.pickle file** for future inference purposes. 
- For inference, again encodings are generated for face present in the input image.
- Using a **threshold value** as strictness measure, **Euclidean distances are compared** through the pickle file and the most **closest face** is recognised to be that of the user.
- Name and ID of recognised user is displayed.

### Salient Features

- Accurate results even in boundary cases:
- Different facial orientation
- Obscured face 
- Presence of Spectacles
- Modified facial features(beard)

- RHS image is the image which is saved by the user for later recognition and whose embeddings are stored in .pickle file
- Trained Image of Salman was **without Beard**, image we given to system to be recognized is **having beard**, still our system recognises person accurately

- We **did not trained** virat kohliâ€™s image, and similarity score obtained by our model **exceeds our threshold value** set, therefore it gives result as **unknown person**

- here the inference image has different **facial orientation** and **Obscured face**, even few people will fail to recognize this image of his struggling days but still our model **accurately recognized the face**
